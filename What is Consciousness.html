      <h2>What is Consciousness?</h2>

      <p>
        Consciousness is one of the deepest mysteries in both philosophy and neuroscience. From Descartes’ “I think, therefore I am” to today’s brain imaging technology, humans have been obsessed with what it means to be aware.
        Some philosophers argue consciousness is simply a byproduct of complex computation, while others say it's something immaterial—beyond what machines can ever replicate. But what if an AI system could describe emotions, reflect on itself, or express creativity? Would that mean it’s conscious?
      </p>

      <p>
        Neuroscientists often refer to the "hard problem" of consciousness: why do we feel anything at all? Why isn’t the brain just processing information silently? If AI mimics that processing—does it mimic feeling too?
      </p>

      <p>
        In this post, we explore various theories of consciousness and what they might mean for AI. Can a machine ever say "I" and mean it? Or is that just clever code?
